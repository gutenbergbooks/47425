    <h2>
      THE FOLIO OF THE PLAYS, 1623.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>T is now
      universally admitted that the Plays known as Shakespeare's are the
      greatest "Birth of Time," the most wonderful product of the human mind
      which the world has ever seen, that they evince the ripest classical
      scholarship, the most perfect knowledge of Law, and the most intimate
      acquaintance with all the intricacies of the highest Court life.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Plays as we know them, appeared in the Folio, published in 1623, seven
      years after Shakespeare's death in 1616. This volume contains thirty-six
      plays. Of this number only eight are substantially in the form in which
      they were printed in Shakespeare's lifetime. Six are greatly improved.
      Five are practically rewritten, and seventeen are not known to have been
      printed before Shakespeare's death, although thirteen plays of similar
      names are registered or in some way referred to.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following particulars are mainly derived from Reed's "Bacon our
      Shakespeare," published 1902. The spelling of the first Folio of 1623 has,
      however, been strictly followed.
    </p>
    <h3>
      THE EIGHT WHICH ARE PRINTED IN THE FOLIO SUBSTANTIALLY AS THEY ORIGINALLY
      APPEARED IN THE QUARTOS ARE:&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p>
      1. Much ado about Nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Loves Labour lost. *
    </p>
    <p>
      3. Midsommer Nights Dreame.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. The Merchant of Venice.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. The First part of King Henry the fourth.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. The Second part of K. Henry the fourth.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. Romeo and Juliet.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. The Tragedie of Troylus and Cressida. **
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Note.&mdash;The scene of the play is Navarre and one of the
     characters is Biron. A passport given to Bacon's brother
     Anthony in 1586 from the court of Navarre, is signed
     "Biron." (British Museum Add. MS. 4125).

     ** Note.&mdash;This has a new title and a Prologue in the Folio.
     This extremely learned play which we are told was "never
     clapper-clawd with the palmes of the vulger.... or sullied
     with the smoaky breath of the multitude," has recently been
     shewn by Mrs. Hinton Stewart to be a satire upon the court
     of King James I.
</pre>
    <h3>
      THE SIX WHICH HAVE BEEN GREATLY IMPROVED ARE:&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p>
      1. The Life &amp; death of Richard the second. Corrections throughout.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. The Third part of King Henry the sixt. New title, 906 new lines, and
      many old lines retouched.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. The Life &amp; Death of Richard the Third. 193 new lines added, 2,000
      lines retouched.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. Titus Andronicus. One entire new scene added.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. The Tragedy of Hamlet. Many important additions and omissions.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. King Lear. 88 new lines, 119 lines retouched.
    </p>
    <h3>
      THE FIVE WHICH HAVE BEEN PRACTICALLY REWRITTEN ARE:&mdash;
    </h3>
    <p>
      1. The Merry Wives of Windsor. 1,081 new lines, the text rewritten.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. The Taming of the Shrew. New title, 1,000 new lines added, and
      extensive revision.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. The Life and Death of King John. New title,
    </p>
    <p>
      1,000 new lines including one entire new scene. The dialogue rewritten.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. The Life of King Henry the Fift. New title, the choruses and two new
      scenes added. Text nearly doubled in length.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. The Second part of King Hen. the Sixt. New title, 1,139 new lines, and
      2,000 old lines retouched.
    </p>
    <p>
      [The practice of false-dating books of the Elizabethan period was not
      uncommon, instances of as much as thirty years having been discovered. It
      has been proved by Mr. A. W. Pollard, of the British Museum; by Mr. W. W.
      Greg, Librarian of Trinity College, Cambridge; and by Prof. W. J. Neidig,
      that four of these, viz., "A Midsommer Nights Dreame," and "The Merchant
      of Venice," both dated 1600, and "King Lear," and "Henry the Fift," both
      dated 1608, were in fact printed in 1619, three years after Shakespeare's
      death.]
    </p>
    <h3>
      THE THIRTEEN WHICH SEEM NOT TO HAVE BEEN PRINTED BEFORE SHAKESPEARE'S
      DEATH,
    </h3>
    <p>
      although plays of somewhat similar names are registered or in some way
      referred to, are:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      1. The Tempest.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. The First part of King Henry the Sixt.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. The two Gentlemen of Verona.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. Measure for Measure.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. The Comedy of Errours.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. As you Like it.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. All is well, that Ends well.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. Twelfe-Night, or what you will.
    </p>
    <p>
      9. The Winters Tale.
    </p>
    <p>
      10. The Life and death of Julius CÃ¦sar.
    </p>
    <p>
      11. The Tragedy of Macbeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      12. Anthony and Cleopater.
    </p>
    <p>
      13. Cymbeline King of Britaine.
    </p>
    <h3>
      THE FOUR WHICH SEEM NEITHER TO HAVE BEEN PRINTED NOR REFERRED TO TILL
      AFTER SHAKESPEARE'S DEATH ARE:&mdash; *
    </h3>
    <p>
      1. The Life of King Henry the Eight.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. The Tragedy of Coriolanus.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. Timon of Athens.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. Othello, the Moore of Venice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the above plays, most of those which were printed in Shakespeare's
      lifetime originally appeared anonymously; indeed, no play bore
      Shakespeare's name until New Place, Stratford-on-Avon, had been purchased
      for him and Â£1,000 given to him in 1597. The first play to bear the name
      of W. Shakespere was Loves Labors Lost, which appeared in the following
      year&mdash;1598.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Note.&mdash;The above very strongly confirms Mrs. Gallup's
     reading of the Cypher, viz.: that there are twenty-two new
     plays in the Folio. The Tempest, with Timon of Athens and
     Henry VIII., seems to be largely concerned with the story of
     Bacon's fall from his high offices in 1621, and Emile
     MontÃ©gut, writing in the "Revue des Deux Mondes" of August,
     1865, says that the Tempest is evidently the author's
     literary testament.
</pre>
    <p>
      Stratford, to which Shakespeare was sent in 1597, was at that period much
      farther from London for all practical purposes than Canada is to-day, and
      Shakespeare did not go there for week ends, but he permanently resided
      there, only very occasionally visiting London, when he lodged at Silver
      Street with a hairdresser named Mountjoy.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is exceedingly important and informing to remember that Shakespeare's
      name never appeared upon any play until he had been permanently sent away
      from London, and that his wealth was simply the money&mdash;Â£1,000&mdash;given
      to him in order to induce him to incur the risk entailed by allowing his
      name to appear upon the plays. Such risk was by no means inconsiderable,
      because Queen Elizabeth was determined to punish the author of Richard the
      Second, a play which greatly incensed her; she is reported to have said,
      "Seest thou not that I am Richard the Second?" There is no evidence that
      Shakespeare ever earned so much as ten shillings in any one week while he
      lived in London.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Stratford, Shakespeare sold corn, malt, etc., and lent small sums of
      money, and indeed, was nothing more than a petty tradesman, a fact of
      which we are quite clearly informed in "The Great Assises holden at
      Parnassus," printed in 1645, where Bacon is put as "Chancellor of
      Parnassus," i.e., greatest of the world's poets, and Shakespeare appears
      as "the writer of weekly accounts." This means that the only literature
      for which Shakespeare was responsible consisted of his small tradesman's
      accounts sent out weekly by his clerk; because, as will be shewn
      presently, <b>Shakespeare was totally unable to write a single letter of
      his own name.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us now return to the Folio of Shakespeare's plays, published in 1623.
      On the title page appears a large half-length figure drawn by Martin
      Droeshout, which is known as the Authentic (i.e., the authorised) portrait
      of Shakespeare. Martin Droeshout, I should perhaps mention, is scarcely
      likely to have ever seen Shakespeare, as he was only 15 years of age when
      Shakespeare died. On the cover of this pamphlet will be found a reduced
      facsimile of the title page of the Folio of 1623. It is almost
      inconceivable that people with eyes to see should have looked at this
      so-called portrait for 287 years without perceiving that it consists of a
      ridiculous, "putty-faced mask," fixed upon a stuffed dummy clothed in a
      trick coat. *
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Note.&mdash;This stuffed dummy is surmounted by a mask with an
     ear attached to it not in the least resembling any possible
     human ear, because, instead of being hollowed, it is rounded
     out something like the back side of a shoehorn, so as to
     form a sort of cup to cover and conceal any real ear that
     might be behind it.
</pre>
    <p>
      The "Tailor and Cutter" newspaper, in its issue of 9th March, 1911, stated
      that the figure, put for Shakespeare, in the 1623 Folio, was undoubtedly
      clothed in an impossible coat composed of the back and the front of the
      same left arm. And in the following April the "Gentleman's Tailor
      Magazine," under the heading of a "Problem for the Trade," prints the two
      halves of the coat put tailor fashion, shoulder to shoulder, as shewn here
      on page 2, and says:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is passing strange that something like three centuries should have
      been allowed to elapse before the tailor's handiwork should have been
      appealed to in this particular manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The special point is that in what is known as the authentic portrait of
      William Shakespeare, which appears in the Celebrated first Folio edition,
      published in 1623, a remarkable sartorial puzzle is apparent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The tunic, coat, or whatever the garment may have been called at the
      time, is so strangely illustrated that the right-hand side of the forepart
      is obviously the left-hand side of the back part; and so gives a harlequin
      appearance to the figure, which it is not unnatural to assume was
      intentional, and done with express object and purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Anyhow, it is pretty safe to say that if a Referendum of the trade was
      taken on the question whether the two illustrations shown above [exactly
      as our illustration on page 2] represent the foreparts of the same
      garment, the polling would give an unanimous vote in the negative."
    </p>
    <p>
      Facing the title page of the 1623 first Folio of the plays, on which the
      stuffed and masked dummy appears, is the following description (of which I
      give a photo-facsimile), which, as it is signed B. I., is usually ascribed
      to Ben Jonson:&mdash;

    <p>
      If my readers will count all the letters in the above, including the four
      v's, which are used instead of the two w's, they will find that there are
      287 letters, a masonic number often repeated throughout the Folio. My
      book, "Bacon is Shakespeare," was published in 1910 (i.e., 287 years after
      1623), and tells for the first time the true meaning of these lines.
    </p>
    <p>
      B. I. never calls the ridiculous dummy a portrait, but describes it as
      "the Figure," "put for" (i.e., instead of), and as "the Print," and as
      "his Picture," and he distinctly tells us to look not at his (ridiculous)
      Picture, but (only) at his Booke.
    </p>
    <p>
      It has always been a puzzle to students who read these verses why B. I.
      lavished such extravagant praise upon what looks so stiff and wooden a
      figure, about which Gainsborough, writing in 1768, says: "Damn the
      original picture of him... for I think a stupider face I never beheld
      except D... k's... it is impossible that such a mind and ray of heaven,
      could shine with such a face and pair of eyes."
    </p>
    <p>
      To those capable of properly reading the lines, B. I. clearly tells the
      whole story. He says, "The Graver had a strife with Nature to out-doo the
      life." In the New English Dictionary, edited by Sir James Murray, we find
      more than six hundred words beginning with "out." Every one of these, with
      scarcely an exception, must, in order to be fully understood, be read
      reversed; outfit is fit out, outfall is fall out, outburst is burst out,
      etc. Outlaw does not mean outside the law, but lawed out by some legal
      process. "Out-doo" therefore must here mean "do out," and was continually
      used for hundreds of years in that sense. Thus in the "Cursor Mundi,"
      written in the Thirteenth Century, we read that Adam was "out-done" [of
      Paradise]. In 1603 Drayton published his "Barons' Wars," and in Book V. s.

    <p class="indent20">

    </p>
    <p>
      B. I. therefore tells us that the Graver has done out the life, that is,
      covered it up and masked it. The Graver has done this so cleverly that for
      287 years (i.e., from 1623 till 1910) learned pedants and others have
      looked at the dummy without perceiving the trick that had been played upon
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      B. I. then proceeds to say:&mdash;"O, could he but have drawne his wit as
      well in brasse, as he hath hit his face." Hit, at that period, was often
      used as the past participle of hide, with the meaning hid or hidden,
      exactly as we find in Chaucer, in "The Squieres Tale," where we read, ii.
      512, etc.,
    </p>

    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      This, put into modern English prose, means, Just as a serpent hid himself
      under the flowers until he might see his time to bite.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have already explained how B. I. tells the reader not to look at the
      picture, but at the book; perhaps the matter may be still more clear if I
      give a paraphrase of the verses.

      "Do out" appears as the name of the little instrument something like a
      pair of snuffers, called a "douter," which was formerly used to extinguish
      candles. Therefore, I have correctly substituted "extinguish" for
      "out-do." At the beginning I have substituted "dummy" for "figure" because
      we are told that the figure is "put for" (that is, put instead of)
      Shakespeare. "Wit" in these lines means absolutely the same as "mind"
      which I have used in its place, because I feel sure that it refers to the
      fact that upon the miniature of Bacon in his eighteenth year, painted by
      Hilliard in 1578, we read:&mdash;"Si tabula daretur digna animum mallem,"
      the translation of which is&mdash;"If one could but paint his mind!"
    </p>
    <p>
      This important fact which can neither be disputed nor explained away,
      viz., that the figure upon the title page of the first Folio of the plays
      in 1623 put to represent Shakespeare is a doubly left-armed and stuffed
      dummy, surmounted by a ridiculous putty-faced mask, disposes once and for
      all of any idea that the mighty plays were written by the drunken,
      illiterate clown of Stratford-on-Avon, and shows us quite clearly that the
      name "Shakespeare" was used as a left-hand, a pseudonym, behind which the
      great author, Francis Bacon, wrote securely concealed. In his last prayer,
      Bacon says, "I have though in a despised weed procured the good of all
      men," while in the 76th "Shakespeare" sonnet he says:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Why write I still all one, ever the same,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And keepe invention in a noted weed.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      That every word doth almost sel my name
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Shewing their birth, and where they did proceed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Weed signifies disguise, and is used in that sense by Bacon in his "Henry
      VII.," where he says, "This fellow... clad himself like an Hermite and in
      that weede wandered about the countrie."
    </p>
    <p>
      It is doubtful if at that period it was possible to discover a meaner
      disguise, a more "despised weed," than the pseudonym of William
      Shakespeare, of Stratford-on-Avon, Gentleman. Bacon also specially refers
      to his own great "<i>descent</i> to the Good of Mankind" in the wonderful
      prayer which is evidently his dedication of the "Immortal Plays."

      In the "Promus," which is the name of Bacon's notebook now in the MSS.
      department of the British Museum, Bacon tells us that "Tragedies and
      Comedies are made of one Alphabet." His beautiful prayer, described as the
      Form and Rule of our Alphabet, was first published in 1679 in "Certaine
      Genuine Remains of Sir Francis Bacon, Baron of Verulam and Viscount St.
      Albans," where it appears as a fragment of a book written by the Lord
      Verulam and entituled, "The Alphabet of Nature." In the preface we are
      told that this work is commonly said to be lost. "The Alphabet of Nature"
      is, of course, "The Immortal Plays," known to us as Shakespeare's, which
      hold "The Mirror up to Nature," and are now no longer lost, but restored
      to their great author, Francis Bacon.

    <h2>
      BACON SHEWN BY CONTEMPORARY TITLE PAGES TO BE THE AUTHOR OF THE
      SHAKESPEARE PLAYS.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span> HAVE shewn on pp.
      6 to 9 that the title page of the 1623 Folio of the Plays known as
      Shakespeare's is adorned with a supposed portrait of Shakespeare, which
      is, in fact, a putty-faced mask supported on a stuffed dummy wearing a
      coat with two left arms, to inform us that the Stratford clown was a
      "left-hand," a "dummy," a "pseudonym," behind which the great Author was
      securely concealed.
    </p>
    <p>
      This fact disposes once and for all of the Shakespeare myth, and I will
      now proceed to prove by a few contemporary evidences that the real author
      was Francis Bacon.
    </p>
    <p>
      I place before the reader on page 11 a photographically enlarged copy of
      the engraved title page of Bacon's work, the De Augmentis, which was
      published in Holland in 1645. "De Augmentis" is the Latin name for the
      work which appeared in English as the Advancement of Learning.
    </p>
    <p>
      This same engraved title page was for more than one hundred years used for
      the title page of Vol. I. of various editions of Bacon's collected works
      in Latin, which were printed abroad. The same subject, but entirely
      redrawn, was also employed for other foreign editions of the De Augmentis,
      but nothing in any way resembling it was printed in England until quite
      recently, when photo-facsimile copies were made of it for the purpose of
      discussing the authorship of the "Shakespeare" plays. In this title page
      we see in the foreground on the right of the picture (the reader's left)
      Bacon seated with his right hand in brightest light resting upon an open
      book beneath which is a second book (shall we venture to say that these
      are the De Augmentis and the Novum Organum?), while with his left-hand in
      deepest shadow, Bacon is putting forward a mean man, who appears to the
      careless observer to be running away with a third book. Let us examine
      carefully this man. We shall then perceive that he is clothed in a goat
      skin. The word tragedy is derived from the Greek word tragodos, which
      means an actor dressed in a goat skin. We should also notice that the man
      wears a false breast to enable him to represent a woman; there were no
      women actors at the time of Shakespeare's plays. The man, therefore, is
      intended to represent the tragic muse. With his left hand, and with his
      left hand only, he grips strongly a clasped sealed, concealed book, which
      by the crossed lines upon its side (then, as now, the symbol of a mirror)
      is shewn to be the "Mirror up to Nature," the "Book of the Immortal
      Plays," known to us under the name of Shakespeare, which, together with
      Bacon's De Augmentis and his Novum Organum, makes up the "Great
      Instauration," by which Bacon has "procured the good of all men."

      <a href="images/0015.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      Having very carefully considered this plate of the title page of the De
      Augmentis, 1645, let us next examine the plate on page 13, which is the
      title page that forms the frontispiece of Bacon's Henry VII. in the Latin
      edition, printed in Holland in 1642. This forms, with the 1645 edition of
      the De Augmentis, one of the series of Bacon's collected works which were
      continually reprinted for upwards of a hundred years. In this title page
      of Henry VII. we see the same "left-handed" story most emphatically
      repeated. On the right of the engraving&mdash;the reader's left&mdash;upon
      the higher level, Francis Bacon stands in the garb of a philosopher with
      grand Rosicrucian rosettes upon his shoes. By his side is a knight in full
      armour, who, like himself, touches the figure with his right hand. On the
      "left" side of the picture upon the <i>lower level</i> we see that the
      same Francis Bacon, who is now wearing <i>actor's boots</i>, is stopping
      the wheel with the shaft of a spear which, the "left-handed" actor grasps
      (or shall we say "shakes"), while with his "left hand" he points to the
      globe. This actor wears one spur only, and that upon his "left" boot, and
      his sword is also girded upon him "left-handedly." Above this
      "left-handed" actor's head, upon the wheel which the figure is turning
      with her "left" hand, we see the emblems of the plays; the mirror up to
      nature (observe the crossed lines to which we called attention in
      reference to the crossed lines upon the book in the title page of the De
      Augmentis, 1645)&mdash;the rod for the back of fools&mdash;"the bason that
      receives your guilty blood" (see Titus Andronicus v. 2) which is here the
      symbol for tragedy,&mdash;and the fool's rattle or bauble. That the man is
      not a knight, but is intended to represent an actor, is manifest from his
      wearing actor's boots, a collar of lace, and leggings trimmed with lace,
      and having his sword girded on the wrong side, while he wears but one
      gauntlet and that upon his "left" hand. That he is a Shake-speare actor is
      also evident because he is shaking the spear which is held by Bacon. He is
      likewise a shake-spur actor, as is shewn by his wearing one spur only,
      which is upon his "left" boot. In other emblematic writings and pictures
      we similarly get "Shake-spur," meaning "Shake-speare."
    </p>
    <p>
      The reader cannot fail to remark how perpetually it is shewn that
      everything connected with the plays is performed "left-handedly," that is,
      "underhandedly" and "secretly in shadow." On the right-hand side upon the
      higher level the figure with her right hand holds above Bacon's head a
      salt box. This is in order to teach us that Bacon was the "wisest of
      mankind," because we are plainly told in the "Continuation of Bacon's New
      Atlantis" (which was published in 1660, but of which the author who is
      called "R. H., Esq.," has never been identified) that in "our Heraldry"
      (which refers to the symbolic drawings that appear mostly as the
      frontispieces of certain books such as those before the reader) "If for
      wisdom she (the virgin) holds a salt." But the reader will perceive that
      in her right hand she also holds something else above Bacon's head.

    </h5>
    <p>
      Only a considerable knowledge of Emblems and Emblem books enables me to
      inform my readers what this very curious object represents. It is
      absolutely certain that what she holds above Bacon's head is a "bridle
      without a bit," which is here put for the purpose of instructing us that
      the future age is not to curb and muzzle and destroy Bacon's reputation.
      This emblem tells us that, as the ages roll on, Bacon will be unmuzzled
      and crowned with everlasting fame. How do we know so much as this? In
      February, 1531, the first edition of the most important of all Emblem
      books, viz., "Alciati's Emblems," was published, and in that book there is
      shewn a hideous figure of Nemesis holding a bridle in which is a
      tremendous "bit" to destroy "improba verba," false reputations. A little
      more than a hundred years later, viz., in 1638, Baudoin, who had
      translated Bacon's essays into French, also published a book of Emblems, a
      task which, he tells us in the preface, he was induced to undertake by
      "Alciat" (printed in small letters) and by BACON (printed in capital
      letters). In this book of Emblems Baudoin puts opposite to Bacon's name a
      fine engraving of Nemesis, but which is, in fact, a figure of Fame holding
      a "bridle without a bit," of exactly the same shape as that shewn in the
      title page of "Henry VII.," which is now under the reader's eyes. I may
      perhaps here state that I possess books that must have belonged to a
      distinguished Rosicrucian who was well acquainted with Bacon's secrets,
      and that in my library there is a specially printed copy of Baudoin's book
      in which this figure of Fame that is put as the Nemesis for Bacon, is
      purposefully printed upside down; I do not mean bound upside down, but
      printed upside down, the printing on the back being reversed and so
      reading correctly. Other books which I possess have portions similarly
      purposefully printed upside down to afford revelations of Bacon's
      authorship to those readers who are capable of understanding symbols. This
      particular upside down drawing of the Nemesis placed opposite to Bacon's
      name in Baudoin's book is so printed in order to emphasise the author's
      meaning that the Nemesis for Bacon is to unmuzzle him and spread his fame
      over all the world. This "specially printed" copy of Baudoin's book is
      also "specially bound"&mdash;in contemporary binding&mdash;with
      Rosicrucian Emblems on the back.
    </p>
    <p>
      The figure which turns the wheel turns it with her "left" hand, while with
      her right hand she holds over Bacon's head what the reader now knows to be
      the emblems of Wisdom and of Fame. Streaming from her head is a long lock
      of hair which is correctly described as "the forelock of time," and this
      is to teach us that as time goes on so will Bacon's reputation continually
      extend farther and farther.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bacon in his will declared that he bequeathed his "name and memory... to
      foreign nations and the next ages." * Bacon knew that much time must
      elapse before the world would begin to recognise how much he had done for
      its advancement, and there is considerable evidence that he fixed upon the
      year 1910, which is 287 years after the year 1623, in which the Folio
      edition of the immortal plays, known as Shakespeare's, first appeared.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Note.&mdash;The following story, related by Ben Jonson himself,
     shows how necessary it was for Bacon to conceal his identity
     behind various' masks:&mdash;"He [Ben Jonson] was dilated by Sir
     James Murray to the King, for writing something against the
     Scots, in a play Eastward Hoe, and voluntarly imprissonned
     himself with Chapman and Marston who had written it amongst
     them. The report, was that they should then [have] had their
     ears cut and noses. After their delivery, he banqueted all
     his friends; there was Camden, Selden, and others; at the
     midst of the feast his old Mother dranke to him, and shew
     him a paper which she had (if the sentence had taken
     execution) to have mixed in the prisson among his drinke,
     which was full of lustie strong poison, and that she was no
     churle, she told, she was minded first to have drunk of it
     herself." This was in 1605, and it is a strange and grim
     illustration of the dangers that beset men in the Highway of
     Letters.
</pre>
    <p>
      With respect to Bacon's remarkable reference to foreign nations, we must
      remember that the title pages here shown and numerous other striking
      revelations of his authorship of the plays were never printed or published
      in England, but appear only in editions printed in foreign countries. I
      will once more repeat that the title page of the "De Augmentis" clearly
      tells us that Bacon has secretly with his "left hand" placed his great
      work, the "Immortal plays," "the Mirror up to Nature," in the hands of a
      mean actor, and that the title page of "Henry VII." repeats the same
      "lefthanded" story, and tells us that, while the history of Henry VII. is
      written in prose in Bacon's own name, his other histories of the "Kings of
      England" are set forth at the Globe Theatre by the Shakespeare actor,
      concealed behind whom Bacon stands secure. In other words, that Bacon's
      other histories of England will be found in the plays to which is attached
      the name of his pseudonym, the doubly "lefthanded" and masked dummy,
      "William Shakespeare."

    <h2>
      THE SHAKESPEARE SIGNATURES (SO-CALLED).
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">N</span>O scrap of writing
      is in existence which can by any possibility be supposed to have been
      written by William Shakespeare, excepting only the six (so-called)
      signatures. And, since every one of these supposed signatures is
      undoubtedly written by a law clerk, the inference that William
      Shakespeare, of Stratford-upon-Avon, Gentleman, was totally unable to
      write, seems to be incontrovertible.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first so-called signature in the order of date is the one last
      discovered, viz.: that at the Record Office, London. This is attached to
      "Answers to Interrogatories," dated May 1th, 1612, in a petty lawsuit, in
      which it appeared that William Shakespeare, of Stratford-upon-Avon,
      Gentleman, had occasionally lodged in Silver Street at the house of a
      hairdresser named Mountjoy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the "Answers to Interrogatories" those which were signed very
      carefully by Daniell Nicholas, and the "Answers to Interrogatories" from
      William Shakespeare, of Stratford-upon-Avon, Gentleman, which are dated
      May 11th, 1612, are both written in the handwriting of the same law clerk,
      who attached to the latter the name "Wilm Shaxpr" over a neat blot, which
      was probably the mark made by the illiterate "Gentleman" of Stratford, who
      was totally unable to write even a single letter of his own name.
    </p>
    <p>
      To those acquainted with the law script of the period it is abundantly
      evident that the "Wilm Shaxpr" is in the same handwriting as the body of
      the Answers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next (so-called) signatures in order of date are upon the purchase
      deed now in the London Guildhall Library, and upon the mortgage deed of
      the same property, which is in the British Museum. The purchase deed is
      dated March 10th, 1613, and the mortgage deed is dated March 11th, 1613,
      but at that period, as at the present time, when part of the purchase
      money is left on mortgage, the mortgage deed was always dated one day
      after the purchase deed, and always signed one moment before it, because
      the owner cannot part with his property before he receives both the cash
      and the mortgage deed. About twenty-five years ago, I succeeded in
      persuading the City authorities to carry the purchase deed to the British
      Museum, where by appointment we met the officials there, who took the
      mortgage deed out of the show-case and placed it side by side with the
      purchase deed from Guildhall. After a long and careful examination of the
      two deeds, some dozen or twenty officials standing around, everyone agreed
      that neither of the names of William Shakespeare upon the deeds could be
      supposed to be signatures. Recently one of the higher officials of the
      British Museum wrote to me about the matter, and in reply I wrote to him
      and also to the new Librarian of Guildhall that it would be impossible to
      discover a scoundrel who would venture to swear that it was even remotely
      possible that these two supposed signatures of William Shakespeare could
      have been written at the same time, in the same place, with the same pen,
      and the same ink, by the same hand. They are widely different, one having
      been written by the law clerk of the seller, the other by the law clerk of
      the purchaser. One of the so-called signatures is evidently written by an
      old man, the other is written by a young man. The deeds are not stated to
      be signed but only to be sealed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next we come to the three supposed signatures upon the will, dated March
      25th, 1616. Twenty or twenty-five years ago, on several occasions I
      examined with powerful glasses Shakespeare's will at Somerset House, where
      for my convenience it was placed in a strong light, and I arrived at the
      only possible conclusion, viz., that the supposed signatures were all
      written by the law clerk who wrote the body of the will, and who wrote
      also the names of the witnesses, all of which, excepting his own which is
      written in a neat modern looking hand, are in the same handwriting as the
      will itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fact that Shakespeare's name is written by the law clerk has been
      conclusively proved by Magdalene Thumm-Kintzel in the Leipzig Magazine,
      "Der Menschenkenner," of January, 1909, in which photo reproductions of
      certain letters in the body of the will and in the so-called signatures
      are placed side by side, and the evidence is conclusive that they are
      written by the same hand. Moreover, the will was originally drawn to be
      sealed, because the solicitor must have known that the illiterate
      householder of Stratford was unable to write his name. Subsequently,
      however, the word "seale" appears to have been struck out and the word
      "hand" written over it. People unacquainted with the rules of law are
      generally not aware that anyone can, by request, "sign" any person's name
      to any legal document, and that if such person touch it and acknowledge
      it, anyone can sign as witness to his signature. Moreover the will is not
      stated to be signed, but only stated to be "published."
    </p>
    <p>
      In putting the name of William Shakespeare three times to the will the law
      clerk seems to have taken considerable care to show that they were not
      real signatures. They are all written in law script, and the three "W's"
      of "William" are made in the three totally different forms in which "W's"
      were written in the law script of that period. Excepting the "W" the whole
      of the first so-called signature is almost illegible, but the other two
      are quite clear, and show that the clerk has purposefully formed each and
      every letter in the two names "Shakespeare" in a different manner one from
      the other. It is, therefore, impossible for anyone to suppose that the
      three names upon the will are "signatures."
    </p>
    <p>
      I should perhaps add that all the six so-called signatures were written by
      law clerks who were excellent penmen, and that the notion that the
      so-called signatures are badly written has only arisen from the fact that
      the general public, and even many educated persons, are totally ignorant
      of the appearance of the law script of the period. The first of the
      so-called signatures, viz., that at the Record Office, London, is written
      with extreme ease and rapidity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus are for ever disproved each and every one of the writings hitherto
      claimed as "signatures" of William Shakespeare, and as there is not in
      existence any other writing which can be supposed to be from his pen, it
      seems an indisputable fact that he was totally unable to write. There is
      also very strong evidence that he was likewise unable to read.

      BACON SIGNED THE SHAKESPEARE PLAYS.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span> CAREFUL
      examination of the First Folio of "Mr. William Shakespeare's Comedies,
      Histories, and Tragedies," 1623, which are generally known as "The Plays
      of Shakespeare," will prove that Bacon signed the plays in very many ways.
    </p>
    <p>
      I will place a few examples before my readers, and when they have
      carefully studied these they may perhaps (if they can get access to a
      photographic facsimile copy of the First Folio of Shakespeare's Plays,
      1623), be able to discover additional traces of the great author's hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      For reasons which it is not now necessary to discuss, Bacon selected as
      one of the keys to the mystery of his authorship of various works the
      number 53.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Great Folio of the Plays of 1623 is divided into Comedies, Histories,
      and Tragedies. Each of these, although they are all bound in one volume,
      is separately paged. It follows therefore, that there must be three pages
      numbered 53 in the Folio Volume of Shakespeare's Plays. I must also inform
      my readers that every page is divided into two columns, and it is
      absolutely certain that the author himself so arranged these that he knew
      in what column and in what line in such column every word would appear in
      the printed page.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us examine, in the first instance,
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      The First Page 53
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      in the plays. The second column of this page 53 commences with the first
      scene of the fourth act of the "Merry Wives of Windsor" In this act a
      Welsh schoolmaster, "Evans," "Dame Quickly," and a boy named "William"
      appear. The object of the introduction of the Welshman seems to have been
      that he might mispronounce "c" as "g," and so call "hic" "hig," and "hoc"
      "hog." William also is made wrongly to say that the accusative case is
      "hinc" instead of "hunc," and Evans, the Welsh schoolmaster, who should
      have corrected this error made by the boy, repeats the blunder with the
      change of "c" into "g," so as to give without confusion the right
      signature key-words which appear in the second column of the first page
      53, as follow:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Eva</i>. I pray you have your remembrance (childe) <i>Accusative</i>,
      king, hang, hog. *
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Note.&mdash;In the folio Ac-cusativo king, hang, hog are in
     italics as here printed.
</pre>
    <p>
      <i>Qu</i>. Hang-hog, is latten for Bacon, I warrant you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Observe that "Bacon" is spelled with a capital "B," and also note that in
      this way we are told quite clearly that Hang-hog means Bacon. In very
      numerous instances a hog with a halter (a rope with a slip-knot) round its
      neck appears as part of some engraving in some book to which Bacon's name
      has not yet been publicly attached. I shall again refer to "Hang-hog" as
      we proceed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next, let us carefully examine
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      The Second Page 53
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      in the Folio of the Plays, which in the first column contains the
      commencement of the first scene of the second act of the first part of
      "King Henry the Fourth." Two carriers are conversing, and we read:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      1 <i>Car</i>. What Ostler, come away, and be hangd; come away.
    </p>
    <p>
      2 <i>Car</i>. I have a Gammon of Bacon, and two razes of Ginger, to be
      delivered as farre as Charing-crosse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Observe that gammon is spelled with a capital "G," and Bacon also is
      spelled with a capital "B." Thus we have found Bacon in the second page
      53. But I must not forget to inform my readers that this second page 53 is
      really and evidently of set purpose falsely numbered 53, because page 46
      is immediately followed by 49, there being no page numbered 47 or 48 in
      the Histories, the second part of the Plays.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having found what appears to be a revelation in each of the first two
      pages numbered 53 in the First Folio, we must remember that a Baconian
      revelation, in order to be complete, satisfactory, and certain, requires
      to be repeated "three" times. The uninitiated inquirer will not be able to
      perceive upon the third page 53, on which is found the beginning of "The
      Tragedie of Romeo and Juliet," any trace of Bacon, or hog or pig, or
      anything suggesting such things. The initiated will know that the Great
      "Master-Mason" will supply two visible pillars, but that the third pillar
      will be the invisible pillar, the Shibboleth; therefore, the informed will
      not expect to find the third key upon the visible page 53, but upon
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      The Invisible Page 53.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Most of my readers will not fail to perceive that the invisible page 53
      must be the page that is 53, when we count not from the beginning, but
      from the end of the book of Tragedies, that is, from the end of the
      volume.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last page in the Folio is 399. This is falsely numbered 993, not by
      accident or by a misprint, but (as the great cryptographic book, by
      Gustavus Selenus [The man in the Moon], published in 1624, will tell those
      who are able to read it) because 993 forms the word "Baconus," a signature
      of Bacon. Let me repeat that the last page of the Great Folio of the plays
      is page 399, and deducting 53 from 399 we obtain the number 346, which is
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      The Page 53 from the end.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      On this page, 346, in the first column, we find part of "The Tragedie of
      Anthony and Cleopatra," and we there read,
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Enobar</i>. Or if you borrow one another's Love for the instant, you
      may when you heare no more words of <i>Pompey</i> returne it againe: you
      shall have time to wrangle in, when you have nothing else to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i> Anth</i>. Thou art a Souldier, onely speake no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Enob</i>. That trueth should be silent, I had almost forgot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now here we perceive that "Pompey,"
    </p>
    <p>
      "in," and "got," by the manner in which the type is arranged in the
      column, come directly under each other, and their initial letters being P.
      I. G., we quite easily read "pig," which is what we were looking for.
    </p>
    <p>
      But on this "invisible" page 53, in which the key-word is found, other
      very important revelations may also be discovered, because it is the
      "Shibboleth" page. If we count the headline title and all the lines that
      come to the left-hand edge of the column on this page 346, we find that
      "Pompey" which begins the word, "pig" is upon
    </p>

      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">

    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Bacon very frequently signed with some form of cypher the first page of
      his secret books. Let us, then, look at the first page of the Great Folio
      of 1623, on which is the commencement of the play of "The Tempest." In the
      first column of that first page we shall read
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      is perfect Gallowes: stand fast good Fate to his han
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      ging, make the rope of his destiny our cable, for our

    <p class="indent10">

    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      hang'd, our case is miserable.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Here, reading upwards from hang'd, we read hang'd, H. O. G., the "h" of
      hang'd being twice used. And just as "<i>Pompey"</i> the commencement of
      Pig, is upon the 43rd line of page 346 (the invisible page 53), so here on
      page 1 the commencing word "hang'd" is also upon
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      The 43rd Line (Example 2.)
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      counting all the lines without exception, including as before the
      head-line titles. Observe, that it is only made possible for us to read
      "hang'd hog," because by the printer's "error" hanging is divided
      improperly as han-ging instead of hang-ing. This apparent misprint is a
      most careful arrangement made by the great author himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      I must once again repeat that there are no misprints or errors in the
      First Folio, 1623, because the great author was alive, and most carefully
      arranged every column in every page, and every word in every column, so
      that we should find every word exactly where we do find such particular
      word. Hang'd hog is, therefore, clearly the signature of the great author
      upon the first page of the Folio, just as 993 is his signature upon the
      last page of the Folio. But, as I have already said, in order to obtain a
      full, certain and complete revelation we must discover a third example.
      This we shall find in the second column of
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      The First Page 43. (Example 3.)
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      wherein is the first scene of the second act of "The Merry Wives of
      Windsor," where we read as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mis. Page</i>. What's the matter, woman?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mi. Ford</i>. O woman: if it were not for one trifling respect, I could
      come to such honour.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mi. Page</i>. Hang the trifle (woman) take the honour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here, reading the initial letters of each line upwards from "Hang," we get
      quite clearly S. O. W., and we perceive that "Hang sow" is just as much
      Bacon as is Hang hog. Thus, we get a triplet of No. 43, as we had a
      triplet of page 53, but we should also realise that we get a third
      triplet, because we find
    </p>

      is on page 53 in the Comedies, the first portion of the plays, and
      "Hang-hog is Bacon," gives the Shibboleth, and affords the explanation of
      the two previous examples. Thus we have a revelation of Bacon's authorship
      in "three times three" forms, and the revelation is, therefore,
      "absolutely perfect."

      At an early date Bacon selected the number "53" to give in numerous books
      revelations concerning his authorship. In Florio's "Second Frutes,"
      published in 1591, on page 53 we read:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      H. A slice of bacon, would make us taste this wine well.

      S. What ho, set that gammon of bakon upon the board.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Florio was always a servant of Bacon's, and received a pension for "making
      my lord's works known abroad." The above is inserted on page 53 to inform
      us that Bacon's name may be spelled in many different ways, as students of
      various books will find to be the fact.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the "Mikrokosmos," * of which editions both in Latin and in French were
      published at Antwerp in 1592, we find on page 53 a picture of Circe's
      Island, which the intelligent reader will perceive represents "the Stage."
      Beneath it are the words from Proverbs ix. 17, which in our English
      authorised version read, "Stolen waters are sweet, and bread eaten in
      secret is pleasant." Examining this engraving, we perceive in the
      forefront Bacon's boar, drawn exactly as it is heraldically portrayed in
      Bacon's crest, but with a man's head surmounted by a "Cap of Liberty," and
      we should remember the words in Shakespeare's play, "As You Like It"
      (which means'"Wisdom from the mouth of a clown"): "I must have liberty:...
      to blow on whom I please, for so fools have... Invest me in my motley:
      Give me leave to speak my mind, and I will through and through cleanse the
      foule bodie of th' infected world, if they will patiently receive my
      medicine."
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Note.&mdash;The title page is headed with the figure of a
     Chameleon, which forms the "53rd" of "Alciati's Emblems."
     The Chameleon was supposed to assume various appearances,
     and is therefore used as an emblem for Bacon, who assumed
     numerous masks in order to do good to all mankind, though in
     a despised weed."
</pre>
    <p>
      In Bacon's "Advancement of Learning," 1640, first edition in English, we
      find a first page "53." In the margin of this page we find "Alexand":
      (Bacon sometimes alluded to himself as Alexander). But the page 55 is
      misnumbered "53," and on this second and false page "53" we read in the
      margin
    </p>
    <h6>
      S. FRAN<br /> BACON,
    </h6>
    <p>
      all in capital letters, almost the only marginal capital letters in the
      whole of the book, which is Bacon's own book, and yet has this striking
      reference to himself on the false page "53." The number of pages "53"
      (very frequently falsely paged "53"), in which some reference to Bacon or
      to the Plays may be discovered, is very large. I will, however, now quote
      only two other instances.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1664, the third edition of Shakespeare's plays, containing seven extra
      plays, was issued, and the editors, in order to mislead the initiated and
      pretend that they had Bacon's authority for so adding some of his inferior
      plays to his revised selection of the thirty-six plays which formed the
      great Folio of 1623, numbered two pages 53, which they placed opposite to
      each other, and on each of these we find "S. Albans" (Bacon was Viscount
      S. Albans).
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1709, the fifth edition was published by Nicholas Rowe, and in that
      edition there is a proper page 53, and also 55 is misprinted 53 (the only
      mispagination in the whole book of 3,324 pages), and this is made in the
      false page 53 in order to afford a revelation if we carefully read both
      pages "53" together.

    <h2>
      THE NORTHUMBERLAND MANUSCRIPTS.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>N page 25 is shewn
      a type transcript of the cover or outside page of a collection of
      manuscripts in the possession of the Duke of Northumberland, which were
      discovered at Northumberland House in London in 1867 Three years later,
      viz.., in 1870, James Spedding published a thin little volume entituled "A
      Conference of Pleasure," in which he printed a full size facsimile of the
      original of the outside page, which is here reproduced in modern script on
      page 25. He also gave a few particulars of the MSS. themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1904, Mr. Frank J. Burgoyne brought out a Collotype Facsimile of every
      page that now remains of the collection of MSS. in an edition limited to
      250 copies, in a fine Royal Quarto at the price of Â£4 4s. each. Of the
      MSS. mentioned on the cover, nine only now remain, and of these, six are
      certainly by Francis Bacon; the first being written by him for a Masque or
      "fanciful devise," which Mr. Spedding thinks was presented at the Court of
      Elizabeth in 1592.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reader's attention is directed to this Masque, which consists of "The
      praise of the Worthiest Vertue, &amp;c," Lower down we read: "Speaches for
      my Lord of Essex at the tylt,"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Speach for my Lord of Sussex tilt,"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Orations at Graies Inne revells." We must remember that in numerous
      instances when masques were presented, reference is made to Bacon having
      in some way countenanced them or assisted them by taking part in the
      arrangement of the "dumb shew." This teaches us how familiar Bacon was
      with stage presentations.
    </p>

      <a href="images/0029.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      Further down on the page we find "Rychard the second" and "Rychard the
      third." Mr. Spedding declared himself satisfied that these were the
      (so-called) Shakespeare plays. Immediately above, we read "William
      Shakespeare," which appears to be part of the original writing upon the
      page.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not necessary here to refer to the remainder of these original
      writings, but there is a mass of curious scribblings all over the page.
      Concerning these, Mr. Spedding says: "I find nothing in these later
      scribblings or in what remains of the book itself to indicate a date later
      than the reign of Elizabeth." They are therefore written by a contemporary
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the purpose of reference I have placed the letters a b c d e outside
      of the facsimile.
    </p>
    <p>
      (a) "Honorificabilitudine." This curious long word, when taken in
      conjunction with the words "Your William Shakespeare," which are found
      more than once upon the page, appears to have some reference to the longer
      word "Honorificabili-tudinitatibus," which is found in "Loves Labors
      Lost," printed in 1598, the first play to which the name of Shakespeare
      (spelled Shakespere) was attached. I must repeat that upon no play
      appeared the name William Shakespeare until that man had been sent
      permanently away to Stratford in 1597. The long word, as I shew in my
      book, "Bacon is Shakespeare," Chapter X., page 84, gives us the Masonic
      number 287, and really tells us with the most absolute mechanical
      certainty that the plays were Francis Bacon's "orphan" children.
    </p>
    <p>
      (b) "By Mr. ffrauncis William Shakespeare Baco"&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
      observe that ffrauncis is repeated "upside down," over these lines, and
      that <i>your/yourself</i>" also printed upside down, appears at the
      commencement of the lines. The reader will therefore not be surprised to
      read at (c) "revealing day through every crany peepes"; which seems to be
      a particularly accurate account of the object of the revelations afforded
      by the "Scribblings" so called, viz., to inform us that "Bacon was
      Shakespeare." The same kind of revelation is again repeated at (d), when
      we find <i>your/William Shakespeare</i> and then above it "Shak
      Shakespeare" and "your William Shakespeare." And the reader should
      remember that, as Mr. Spedding admits, all these so-called "scribblings"
      were contemporary and written before 1603, the date of the death of Queen
      Elizabeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also call attention at (e) to the three curious scrolls, each written
      with one continuous sweep of the pen, which it would take a great deal of
      practice to succeed in successfully and easily writing. I myself am in a
      particularly fortunate position with regard to these scrolls, because I
      possess a very fine large-paper copy of "Les Tenures de Monsieur
      Littleton," 1591. This work is annotated throughout in what the British
      Museum authorities admit to be the handwriting of Francis Bacon, and, upon
      the wide large paper margin of the title page, eight similar scrolls
      appear, which have evidently some (shall we say Rosicrucian) significance.
      *
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Note.&mdash;A few copies of my book, "Bacon is Shakespeare,"
     published by Gay &amp; Hancock, are still on sale at the price
     of 2s. '6d. No important statement contained therein has
     been or ever will be successfully controverted because the
     facts stated are derived from books contained in my unique
     library, which includes works that must have belonged to a
     distinguished Rosicrucian who was well acquainted with the
     secrets of Bacon's authorship.
</pre>
    <p>
      Perhaps I should add that here, in this little book, before the reader's
      eyes, is the knowledge of this revealing page of the Northumberland MSS.
      given for the first time wide publicity. Spedding's little book, which has
      been long out of print, was too insignificant to attract much notice, and
      Mr. Burgoyne's splendid work was too expensive for ordinary purchasers.

    <h2>
      BACON AND THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>E owe our mighty
      English tongue of to-day to Francis Bacon and to Francis Bacon alone. The
      time has now come when this stupendous fact should be taught in every
      school, and that the whole of the Anglo-Saxon speaking peoples should know
      that the most glorious birthright which they possess, their matchless
      language,was the result of the life and labour of one man, viz.&mdash;Francis
      Bacon, who, when as little more than a boy, he was sent with our
      ambassador, Sir Amyas Paulett, to Paris, found there that "La PlÃ©iade"
      (the Seven) had just succeeded in creating the French language from what
      had before been as they declared "merely a barbarous jargon." Young Bacon
      at once seized the idea and resolved to create an English language capable
      of expressing the highest thoughts. All writers are agreed that at the
      commencement of the reign of Queen Elizabeth, English as a "literary"
      language did not exist. All writers are agreed that what is known as the
      Elizabethan Age was the most glorious period of English literature. All
      writers are agreed that our language of to-day is founded upon the English
      translation of the Bible and upon the Plays of Shakespeare. Every word of
      each of these was undoubtedly written by, or under the direction of,
      Francis Bacon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Max MÃ¼ller, in his "Science of Language," Vol. I., 1899, page 378, says:
      "A well educated person in England who has been at a public school and at
      the university... seldom uses more than about 3,000 or 4,000 words.... The
      Hebrew Testament says all that it has to say with 5,642 words, Milton's
      poetry is built up with 8,000, and Shakespeare, who probably displayed a
      greater variety of expression than any writer in any language produced all
      his plays with about 15,000 words."
    </p>
    <p>
      Does anyone suppose that any master of the Stratford Grammar School, where
      Latin was the only language used, knew so many as 2,000 English words, or
      that the illiterate householder of Stratford, known as William
      Shakespeare, knew half or a quarter so many?
    </p>
    <p>
      But to return to the Bible&mdash;we mean the Bible of 1611, known as the
      Authorised Version, which J. A. Weisse tells us contains about 15,000
      different words (i.e. the same number as used in the Shakespeare plays).
      It was translated by 48 men, whose names are known, and then handed to
      King James I. * It was printed about one and a half years later. In the
      Preface, which is evidently written by Bacon, we are told "we have not
      tyed ourselves to an uniformitie of phrasing, or to an identitie of
      words." This question of variety of expression is discussed in the Preface
      at considerable length (compare with Max MÃ¼ller's references to
      Shakespeare's extraordinary variety of expression) and then we read: "Wee
      might also be charged... with some unequall dealing towards a great number
      of good English words... if we should say, as it were, unto certaine
      words, Stand up higher, have a place in the Bible alwaies, and to others
      of like qualitie, Get ye hence, be banished for ever." This means that an
      endeavour was made to insert all good English words into this new
      translation of the Bible, so that none might be deemed to be merely
      "secular."
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Note.&mdash;The forty-eight translators made use of "The
     Bishops' Bible," but no copy of this work, on which appear
     any annotations by the translators, can be discovered. See
     Bishop Westcott's "History of the English Bible," 1905, p.
     118.
</pre>
    <p>
      Is it possible that any intelligent person can really read the Bible as a
      whole, not now a bit and now a scrap, but read it straight through like an
      ordinary book and fail to perceive that the majestic rhythm that runs
      through the whole cannot be the language of many writers, but must flow
      from the pen, or at least from the editorship, of one great master mind?
    </p>
    <p>
      A confirmation of this statement that the Authorised Version of King James
      I. was edited by one masterhand is contained in the "Times" newspaper of
      March 22nd, 1912, where Archdeacon Westcott, writing about the Revised
      Version of 1881, says, the revisers "were men of notable learning and
      singular industry.... There were far too many of them; and successful
      literary results cannot be achieved by syndicates."
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, the Bible and Shakespeare embody the language of the great master,
      but before it could be so embodied, the English tongue had to be created,
      and it was for this great purpose that Bacon made his piteous appeals for
      funds to Bodley, to Burleigh, and to Queen Elizabeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Observe the great mass of splendid translations of the Classics (often
      second-hand from the French, as Plutarch's "Lives" by North) with which
      England was positively flooded at that period. Hitherto no writer seems to
      have called attention to the fact that certain of these translations were
      made from the French instead of from the original Greek or Latin, not
      because it was easier to take them from the French, but because in that
      way the new French words and, phrases were enabled to be introduced to
      enrich the English tongue. The sale of these translations could not
      possibly have paid any considerable portion of their cost.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus Bacon worked. Thus his books under all sorts of pseudonyms appeared.
      No book of the Elizabethan Age of any value proceeded from any source
      except from his workshop of those "good pens," over whom Ben Jonson was
      foreman.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a very rare and curious little volume, published anonymously in 1645,
      under the title of "The Great Assises holden in Parnassus by Apollo and
      his Assessours," Ben Jonson is described as the "Keeper of the Trophonian
      Denne," and in Westminster Abbey his medallion bust appears clothed in a
      left-handed coat to show us that he was a servant of Bacon.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      O, rare Ben Jonson&mdash;what a turncoat grown!
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Thou ne'er wast such, till clad in stone;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Then let not this disturb thy sprite,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Another age shall set thy buttons right. '
    </p>
    <p class="indent30">
      Stowe ii., p. 512-13.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this same book, we see on the leaf following the title page the name of
      Apollo in large letters in an ornamental frame, and below it in the place
      of honour we find Francis Bacon placed as "<i>Lord</i> VERULAN <i>Chancellor
      of Parnassus</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      This means that Bacon was the greatest of poets since the world began.
      This proud position is also claimed for him by Thomas Randolf in a Latin
      poem published in 1640, but believed to have been written immediately
      after Bacon's death in 1626. Thomas Randolf declares that Phoebus (i.e.,
      Apollo) was accessory to Bacon's death because he was afraid that Bacon
      would some day come to be crowned king of poetry or the Muses. George
      Herbert, Bacon's friend, who had overlooked many of his works, repeats the
      same story, calling Bacon the colleague of Sol, i.e., Phoebus Apollo.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instances might be multiplied, but I will only quote the words of John
      Davies, of Hereford, another friend of Bacon's, who addresses him in his
      "Scourge of Folly," published about 1610, as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      As to her Bellamour the Muse is wont;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      For, thou dost her embozom; and dost use,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Her company for sport twixt grave affaires.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Bacon was always recognised by his contemporaries as among the greatest of
      poets. Although nothing of any poetical importance bearing Bacon's name
      had been up to that time published, Stowe (in his Annales, printed in
      1615) places Bacon seventh in his list of Elizabethan poets.

    <h2>
      THE SHAKESPEARE MYTH IS DEAD.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>N 1898 the
      Shakespeare myth was mortally wounded by the curious collection of "may
      have beens," "might have beens," "could have beens," "should have beens,"
      "must have beens," etc., collected in Sir Sidney Lee's supposititious life
      of William Shakespeare. In 1910 it was killed by the Cambridge History of
      English Literature, edited by Dr. Ward, Master of Peterhouse, and Mr.
      Waller, also of Peterhouse, for in Volume V., pages 165-6-7, we read: "We
      are not quite sure of the identity of Shakespeare's father; we are by no
      means certain of the identity of his wife.... We do not know whether he
      ever went to school.. . . No biography of Shakespeare, therefore, which
      deserves any confidence has ever been constructed without a large infusion
      of the tell-tale words 'apparently,' 'probably,' 'there can be little
      doubt,' and no small infusion of the still more tell-tale 'perhaps,' 'it
      would be natural,' 'according to what was usual at the time,' and so
      forth... John Shakespeare married Mary Arden, an heiress of a good
      yeomanry family, but as to whose connection with a more distinguished one
      of the same name there remains much room for doubt."
    </p>
    <p>
      I should add that no letter addressed to Shakespeare exists excepting one
      asking for a loan of Â£30; and that no contemporary letter referring to him
      has been discovered excepting three which are about money.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1910 appeared my own book, "Bacon is Shakespeare," which, placed in
      every library in the world, has carried everywhere the news of the decease
      of the myth.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1911 Mark Twain's book, "Is Shakespeare dead?" which had been published
      in 1909 in England, was included in the Tauchnitz collection, and
      therefore likewise carries the news of the decease of the myth all over
      the earth. Mark Twain describes Shakespeare as just a "Tar Baby," and
      says: "About him you can find out nothing. Nothing of any importance.
      Nothing worth the trouble of stowing away in your memory. Nothing that
      even remotely indicates that he was ever anything more than a distinctly
      commonplace person... a small trader in a small village that did not
      regard him as a person of any consequence, and had forgotten all about him
      before he was cold in his grave.... * We can go to the records and find
      out the life-history of every renowned racehorse of modern times&mdash;but
      not Shakespeare's! There are many reasons why, and they have been
      furnished in cartloads (of guess and conjecture). . . but there is one
      that is worth all the rest of the reasons put together, and is abundantly
      sufficient all by itself&mdash;he hadn't any history to tell. There is no
      way of getting round that deadly fact. And no sane way has yet been
      discovered of getting round its formidable significance."
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Note.&mdash;Stratford owes all its glory to two of its sons,
     John, Archbishop of Canterbury, who built a church there;
     and Hugh Clopton, who built, at his own cost, a bridge of
     fourteen arches across the Avon. Translated from Jean Blaeu,
     1645.
</pre>
    <p>
      The Shakespeare myth is now destroyed. Does any educated person of
      intelligence still believe in the "Tar Baby," the illiterate clown of
      Stratford, who was totally unable to write a single letter of his own
      name, and of whom we are told, if we understand what we are told, that he
      could not read a line of print. No book was found in his house, and
      neither of his daughters could either read or write.
    </p>
    <p>
      There exists no "portrait" of Shakespeare. The significant fact that the
      Figure put for Shakespeare in the 1623 Folio of the plays consists of a
      doubly left-handed dummy is alone sufficient to dispose of the Shakespeare
      myth. I have printed in various newspapers all over the world about a
      million copies of articles demonstrating this fact, which none can
      successfully dispute.
    </p>
    <p>
      In modern times Percy Bysshe Shelley&mdash;one of England's greatest poets
      (who knew nothing about the Shakespeare controversy)&mdash;wrote as
      follows: "Bacon was a poet. His language has a sweet and majestic rhythm,
      which satisfies the sense, no less than the almost superhuman wisdom of
      his philosophy satisfies the intellect. It is a strain, which distends and
      then bursts the circumference of the reader's mind, and pours itself forth
      together with it into the universal element with which it has perpetual
      sympathy." This statement by Shelley, taken in conjunction with the
      testimony of "The Great Assises holden in Parnassus," 1645, and the words
      of Thomas Randolf, 1640, and of Bacon's friends George Herbert and John
      Davies, together with the contemporary evidence of Stowe in 1615, are
      sufficient to dispose, once and for all, of the absurd contention that is
      sometimes put forth that Bacon did not possess sufficient poetical ability
      to have written his own greatest work, the Immortal Plays.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Palmerston said that he rejoiced to see the reintegration of Italy,
      the unveiling of the mystery of China, and the explosion of the
      Shakespeare illusions. Lord Houghton, the father of the present Marquis of
      Crewe, said that he agreed with Lord Palmerston. John Bright said any man
      that believed that William Shakespeare wrote "Hamlet," or "Lear," was a
      fool. Prince Bismarck said in 1892: "He could not understand how it were
      possible that a man, however gifted with the intuitions of genius, could
      have written what was attributed to Shakespeare unless he had been in
      touch with the great affairs of State, behind the scenes of political
      life, and also intimate with all the social courtesies and refinements of
      thought which in Shakespeare's time were only to be met with in the
      highest circles."
    </p>
    <p>
      The "Tempest" is over, the false crown of the Island (the Stage) has been
      torn from the head of the dummy that appeared to wear it. It seems
      difficult to imagine that people possessed of ordinary intelligence can
      any longer continue to believe that the most learned of all the literary
      works in the world was written by the most unlearned of men, William
      Shakespeare of Stratford, who never seems even to have attempted to write
      a single letter of his own name. It has been proved that the six so-called
      signatures of Shakespeare were written by various law clerks, and it is
      now admitted that there exist no other writings which can even be supposed
      to be from his pen.
